        <p> Our service connects people around the world over internet. Any activity that you search for in the app might be shared with  people in your vicinity or around the world.
        This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and our other covered services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application such as Palsup iOS app. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.

        If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact yourpal@palsup.com </p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect and use your information below to provide, understand, and improve our Services. please contact yourpal@palsup.com if you have any concerns about the information you have shared with us.</p>
        
        <p><span class="bold">Basic Account Information:</span> If you choose to create a Palsup account, you must provide us with some personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address, or phone number. On Palsup, your name and username are listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results. </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Contact Information:</span> You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable certain account features. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Additional Information:</span> You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and personalize your experience across our Services. For example  we may—after asking for your permission—collect information from your device’s phonebook to let you share information with your contacts or keep in touch with your friends through our application.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Activities you search for, Following, Lists, Profile, and Other Public Information:</span> Palsup is primarily designed to help you discover and share information with the other people. Most of the information you provide us through Palsup is information you are asking us to share with other people, in case they might be interested to connect and communicate with you. You may provide us with profile information such as a short biography, your location, your website, date of birth, or a picture. Additionally, your public information includes the activities you search for in the app; the metadata provided with those activities, such as when you searched for that activity and the client application you used to search; information about your account, such as creation time, language, country, and time zone; and the lists you create, people you follow, activities you Like or attend. Palsup disseminates your public information to a wide range of users. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Group messages, and Non-Public Communications:</span> We provide certain features that allow you to communicate more privately. For example, you can use Group Messages to have private conversations with other Palsup users. When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving Group Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to them. When you use features like Group Messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and re-share the contents of your communications.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Location Information:</span> We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your events and activities. You may also tell us your location when you search for activities nearby. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as allowing you to search activities and find friends nearby, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, suggestions for people and topics to follow. </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Links:</span> We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Cookies:</span> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Using Our Services:</span> We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website, application, or service.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">User Consent or Direction:</span> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Service Providers:</span> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Law and Harm:</span> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information.</p>
