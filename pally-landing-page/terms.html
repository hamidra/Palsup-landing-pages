        <h2>Palsup Terms of Service</h2>
        
        <p> 
          Welcome Pals! <br/> 
          This User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of our apps, services, and other tools and software.
          Our mission at Palsup is to create a comfortable environment for our pals to feel the real sense of community and help them to extend their social circles by joining like minded pals all over the world. 
          A group of wise men once built a city in the middle of a desert with nothing but love and <a href="https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/" target="_blank">10 principles</a>. 
          We encourage our pals to follow the following principals adapted from those <a href="https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/" target="_blank">10 principles</a>
          to build an inclusive community for all of our members:
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Radical Inclusion:</span>
          Anyone may be a part of our communities. We welcome and respect the stranger. 
          No prerequisites exist for participation in our community, only you need to be older than 13 years to join.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Radical Self-expression:</span>
          Any one is entitled to express their views and thoughts on our application as long as they are not harmful to our members or our communities. 
          We will take action to remove the content that seems to be intended to harm a specific person, community, or society.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Communal Effort:</span>
          Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks and communities that can bring our pals together. We believe there is a caring community for everyone in this world that they feel belonged. 
          Our mission is to help our users to discover other like-minded pals to create those communities together. 
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Civic Responsibility:</span>
          We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. 
          They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Participation:</span>
          Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. 
          We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, 
          can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. 
          Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Immediacy:</span>
          Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. 
          We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, 
          the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. 
          No idea can substitute for this experience. We encourage all of our members to practice mindfulness of themselves, 
          their environments, and the other community members. 
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
          We may revise these Terms from time to time.

        </p>
        <p>
          The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Palsup.

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Palsup’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
